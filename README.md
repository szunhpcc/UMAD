Universal Management and Analysis of Data

#Description

The project mainly includes three parts:similarity searching,classfication and outlier 
detection. All those three methods are based on data items in metric space, which 
detection. All those three methods are based on data items in metric space, which 
large amount of cpu time to calculate out the distance between any two complex objects 
shown before.Our methods in the project reduces the times of distance calculation and 
improves the effectiveness of data retrieval.
